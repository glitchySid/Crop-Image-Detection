#About The Project
###This Project includes a model that is capable of pridicting the crops ie. ['jute', 'maize', 'rice', 'sugarcane', 'wheat']
###The following is trained with more than 200 images and has shown a great validation accuracy


**Getting Started**
Prerequisites:

    Python 3.x (with pip package manager)
    TensorFlow (tested with TensorFlow 2.x)
    NumPy
    OpenCV (for image processing)
    Installation:

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) to isolate project dependencies:
`python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Windows: env\Scripts\activate)`

3. Install required libraries:

`pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python`

**how to use**

-prepare your image
-open main.py and change the path to image according to your preference 
-that's all the model will predict the crop images
